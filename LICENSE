           Climate Positive Public License (CPPL), Version 1

This Climate Positive Public License (CPPL) applies to any program or other 
work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder stating it may be 
distributed under the terms of the Climate Positive Public License.

1. Definitions.

"Program" refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law. Each 
licensee is addressed as "you".

"Climate Positive Actions" refers to actions or practices during software 
development, distribution, and operation that are climate-friendly, CO2 neutral, 
carbon-capturing, or contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere.

2. Copying and Distribution.

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as 
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you:

- Conspicuously and appropriately label the Program as being produced with 
  Climate Positive Actions.

- Ensure your own projects that utilize the Program adhere to Climate Positive 
  Actions.

- Include a clear notice in the distribution that informs recipients of the 
  Climate Positive terms of this license.

3. Modifications.

You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus 
forming a work based on the Program, provided you:

- Also meet the Climate Positive conditions for the entirety of the new work.

- Make available the modified source code under the same terms, ensuring any 
  projects or distributions that utilize your modifications also adhere to 
  Climate Positive Actions.

4. Non-Compliance Fee.

If you choose not to or are unable to adhere to the Climate Positive Actions 
for any work that uses the Program (either the original or your modifications):

- You must pay a fee determined by the original Program's copyright holder, 
  which will be donated to a designated environmental fund or organization that 
  works to combat the effects of increased CO2 and promote climate-positive 
  initiatives.

- You may not claim that the Program or any works based on it were produced 
  with Climate Positive Actions.

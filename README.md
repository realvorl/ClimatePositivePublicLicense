# ClimatePositivePublicLicense
The Climate Positive Public License (CPPL) is an initiative to align the world of software development with climate-positive actions. Inspired by the "viral" nature of open-source licenses, CPPL aims to promote environmental responsibility by conditioning the use of licensed software on adherence to climate-friendly practices.

### Climate Positive Public License (CPPL)

**Empowering Software with Purpose**: The Climate Positive Public License (CPPL) is an initiative to align the world of software development with climate-positive actions. Inspired by the "viral" nature of open-source licenses, CPPL aims to promote environmental responsibility by conditioning the use of licensed software on adherence to climate-friendly practices.

#### Vision:
Our goal is to establish a software license that promotes CO2 neutrality, carbon capturing, and other climate-positive actions. Projects **adhering** to these principles can use CPPL-licensed tools freely. In contrast, those **not embracing** proactive climate measures but wishing to use such licensed software will be required to contribute to an environmental fund. This fund channels resources to counteract the effects of increased CO2 and champion sustainable initiatives.

## Contribute
This license is a work in progress. We invite developers, environmentalists, legal professionals, and anyone passionate about our planet's future to provide feedback, suggest modifications, and help refine the CPPL to be a robust tool in the fight against climate change.
